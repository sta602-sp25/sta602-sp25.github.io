## Exercise 1

10.1 from Hoff.

## Exercise 2

8.1 from Hoff. Note there is a typo in this exercise. Every $\theta_i$ in the exercise prompt should be replaced by $\theta_j$.


## Exercise 3

8.3 from Hoff: find the problem setup (definitions of each Greek letter) on page 132 and 133 of the book. Also see, e.g. the [notes on hierarchical modeling](https://sta602-sp25.github.io/notes/lec15-hierarchical-intro.html).

Run the code below to load the data.

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(readr)
library(glue)

for(i in 1:8) {
assign(paste0("school", i), 
       read_csv(glue("https://sta602-sp25.github.io/data/school{i}.csv")))
}
```
